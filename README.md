**Rubiks Cube Solver**
*Introduction*
This project focuses on modeling a Rubik’s Cube and developing a solver using C++. The aim is to translate a physical object into a computer-understandable format and solve it programmatically.

*Features*
Object Modeling: Utilized object-oriented principles to model a Rubik’s Cube, breaking it down into manageable components such as cube representations and solvers.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Demonstrated practical applications of OOP concepts including:
Classes and Objects
Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes
Inheritance
Operator Overloading

*Algorithms*
Pathfinding Algorithms: Implemented various pathfinding algorithms such as BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA* to solve the Rubik’s Cube, showcasing their application in artificial intelligence problems.
Heuristic Search: Explored Heuristic Search Algorithms like A* and IDA*, leveraging Pattern Databases to provide efficient heuristic evaluations.
